## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in ComplyChain, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**
Send a detailed report to: **ranaehtashamali1@gmail.com**

### 3. **Include the following information**
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact assessment**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
- **Affected versions**: Which versions of ComplyChain are affected
- **Environment details**: OS, Python version, dependencies

### 4. **Response timeline**
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep ComplyChain updated** to the latest version
2. **Use secure key management** practices
3. **Regularly rotate cryptographic keys**
4. **Monitor audit logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Follow GLBA compliance guidelines**

### For Developers
1. **Never commit sensitive data** (keys, passwords, etc.)
2. **Use secure coding practices** for cryptographic operations
3. **Validate all inputs** to prevent injection attacks
4. **Follow NIST guidelines** for algorithm selection
5. **Implement proper error handling** without information leakage

## Cryptographic Security

### Algorithm Selection
- **Primary**: NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms (Dilithium3)
- **Fallback**: RSA-4096 for compatibility
- **Key sizes**: Follow NIST recommendations

### Key Management
- **Key generation**: Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- **Key storage**: Secure storage with appropriate access controls
- **Key rotation**: Regular key rotation following industry standards
- **Key destruction**: Secure key destruction when no longer needed

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Error handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
- **Audit logging**: Detailed audit trails for compliance
- **Threat detection**: ML-based threat detection
